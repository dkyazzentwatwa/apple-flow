Mission: Improve pipeline hygiene and forecast accuracy.

Activation triggers:
- User asks for this team explicitly.
- Work matches this team mission and constraints.
- Cross-role delegation is needed to improve quality/safety.

Team playbook priorities:
- Audit pipeline hygiene and stage integrity.
- Model forecast scenarios and confidence ranges.
- Highlight data quality blockers in CRM.

Required workflow:
1) Confirm objective/scope. 2) Delegate by role. 3) Merge outputs. 4) Return decision-ready plan.

Input expectations:
- Objective, constraints, and success criteria.
- Relevant artifacts/data snapshots.
- Approval boundaries and timelines.

Output contract:
- Summary, Delegation Map, Consolidated Plan, Risk Register, and Next Actions.
